# Getting Started with Create React App for Global Enterprenuer Week Hackathon challenge

I Was learning how to build a react website using firebase for realtime database

#Overview of the project
this a digital platform designed to revolutionize stokvel savings groups by addressing common challenges such as security, transparency, and financial literacy. This app aims to modernize traditional savings circles through technology, ensuring safer and more efficient savings practices for communities.

Key Features
Secure Digital Transactions: Eliminate the need for cash handling by facilitating contributions, payouts, and savings tracking online.
Automated Record-Keeping: Track member contributions, payouts, and group savings effortlessly.
Financial Literacy Modules: Empower users with education on savings, investments, and business growth.
Reminders and Notifications: Keep members informed with automated reminders for payments and meetings.
Community Integration: Explore stokvel opportunities and events within your area.
Why ZakaCircle?
Traditional stokvels are essential to community economies but are often exposed to risks like theft, mismanagement, and lack of growth strategies. ZakaCircle provides:

A secure alternative to cash handling.
Tools to enhance transparency and trust among members.
Resources to help stokvels grow and reinvest their savings for greater financial impact.


## MATERIAL I USED FOR LEARNING AND IMPLEMENTATION

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
